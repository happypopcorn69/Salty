## 1. HERO

### Headline
**You're Losing Salt. Deal With It.**

### Subheadline
Your body is a leaky vessel of electrolytes. Every workout, every hot day, every time you exist with any enthusiasm—sodium escapes. SALTWORKS exists because biology doesn't care about your hydration goals.

### CTA
**Get Salty**

### Tagline
ur welcome

## 2. THE CODE

### Section Title
**The Code**

### Intro
Three rules. No exceptions. No negotiation. This isn't a suggestion box.

### Rule 1: Salt Before You Suffer
**Pre-load like you mean it.**
Your body doesn't store sodium like it stores fat (unfortunately). Front-loading electrolytes before activity means your cells actually have what they need when things get intense. Waiting until you feel terrible is a rookie move. ur welcome

### Rule 2: Salt While You Struggle
**Maintain the mineral balance.**
Mid-activity is when most people remember they have needs. Your muscles are firing, your body is dumping sodium faster than a bad stock, and suddenly you're wondering why everything hurts. Keep the supply chain moving.

### Rule 3: Salt After You're Destroyed
**Recovery isn't optional.**
You just depleted yourself. Congratulations. Now replace what you lost or enjoy the headache, cramps, and general feeling of being hit by a truck. The choice is yours, but only one choice is smart.

## 3. FIELD MANUAL

### Section Title
**Field Manual**

### Intro
Three protocols. One mission. Stop being an under-salted disaster.

---

### PRE-FLIGHT PROTOCOL

#### Title
**Pre-Flight**

#### Subtitle
*Before the chaos begins*

#### Content
Loading electrolytes before activity is like checking your parachute before jumping. Sure, you could skip it. Once.

**The Protocol:**
- 30-45 minutes before go-time
- One serving, full glass of water
- No heroics, no doubling up
- Just basic preparation like a functioning adult

Your cells will thank you by actually working. ur welcome

---

### LOADOUT PROTOCOL

#### Title
**Loadout**

#### Subtitle
*During the grind*

#### Content
You're in it now. Your body is hemorrhaging minerals like it's trying to lighten the load for a sinking ship. This is not the time for rationing.

**The Protocol:**
- Every 45-60 minutes of sustained effort
- Sip, don't chug (your stomach will revolt)
- Adjust based on intensity and conditions
- If it's hot, you need more. If you're going hard, you need more. If both, you definitely need more.

Maintaining electrolyte balance during activity is the difference between finishing strong and becoming a cautionary tale.

### RESET PROTOCOL

#### Title
**Reset**

#### Subtitle
*After the damage is done*

#### Content
The work is done. You're depleted, tired, and possibly questioning your life choices. Now is when recovery either happens or doesn't.

**The Protocol:**
- Within 30 minutes of finishing
- Full serving with adequate water
- Pair with actual food if you can manage it
- Then rest, because you've earned it

Tomorrow's performance depends on today's recovery. Skip this step and you'll feel it. ur welcome

## 4. WHY HUMANS WON

### Section Title
**Why Humans Won**

### Big Statement
**You're Built Different. Literally.**

### The Story

#### Part 1: The Weird Advantage
Millions of years ago, our ancestors looked at the African savanna and made a choice that seemed insane: chase animals until they collapsed. Not with speed—we're pathetically slow. Not with strength—a chimp would wreck us. With something weirder.

**Endurance.**

While every other predator sprints and rests, sprints and rests, early humans just... kept going. Walking. Jogging. Following. For hours. Sometimes days. Until prey that could outrun us in any short race simply gave up and died of exhaustion.

#### Part 2: The Cooling System
Here's the biological cheat code: humans are the greatest heat-dumping machines the animal kingdom has ever produced. We have more cooling glands per square inch than almost any other creature. We can regulate core temperature during sustained effort in ways that would kill most mammals.

This is why a human can run a marathon in the desert while a horse would die trying. This is why persistence hunting worked. This is why YOU exist.

#### Part 3: The Cost
But nothing's free.

All that magnificent temperature regulation comes with a price tag: mineral loss. Sodium, potassium, magnesium—your body ejects them constantly to keep you cool enough to survive. It's a feature, not a bug, but features need maintenance.

**Your ancestors survived because they could dump heat.**
**You thrive because you replace what's lost.**

Every serving of electrolytes is a tiny tribute to the salty, stubborn, magnificent weirdos who chased antelope across the savanna until the antelope quit. ur welcome

## 5. SALINITY INDEX

### Section Title
**Salinity Index**

### Intro
Real-time data for people who make decisions based on evidence, not vibes.

### Widget Placeholder Text
**[WIDGET AREA]**

*Current conditions loading...*

Your local environment affects your electrolyte needs. Hot and humid? You're losing more. Dry and cool? Still losing, just slower. This widget exists because "drink when you're thirsty" is advice for people who enjoy feeling terrible.

### Data Points Preview
- **Temperature**: How much the air hates you today
- **Humidity**: The thickness of said hate
- **UV Index**: Solar assault level
- **Your Recommendation**: What you actually need

Check conditions. Adjust intake. Stop guessing. ur welcome

### Legal Mumble
SALTWORKS is not medical advice. We're electrolytes, not doctors. If something feels wrong, consult an actual healthcare professional instead of a website.

### Final Word
You made it to the footer. Impressive scrolling stamina. Now go drink some water with your electrolytes.
