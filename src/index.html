                        <p>Millions of years ago, our ancestors looked at the African savanna and made a choice that seemed insane: chase animals until they collapsed. Not with speed—we're pathetically slow. Not with strength—a chimp would wreck us. With something weirder.</p>
                        <p class="story-emphasis">Endurance.</p>
                        <p>While every other predator sprints and rests, sprints and rests, early humans just... kept going. Walking. Jogging. Following. For hours. Sometimes days. Until prey that could outrun us in any short race simply gave up and died of exhaustion.</p>

                        <p>Here's the biological cheat code: humans are the greatest heat-dumping machines the animal kingdom has ever produced. We have more cooling glands per square inch than almost any other creature. We can regulate core temperature during sustained effort in ways that would kill most mammals.</p>
                        <p>This is why a human can run a marathon in the desert while a horse would die trying. This is why persistence hunting worked. This is why YOU exist.</p>

                        <p>All that magnificent temperature regulation comes with a price tag: mineral loss. Sodium, potassium, magnesium—your body ejects them constantly to keep you cool enough to survive. It's a feature, not a bug, but features need maintenance.</p>
