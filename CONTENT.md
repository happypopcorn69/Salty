## WHAT IS THIS
WHAT IS THIS
I've always had what I generously call "salty super powers." For most of my life they stayed dormant — only activating at peak inconvenience. Job interviews. The dentist chair. Sex. Anywhere the universe thought "you know what would make this worse?"
Then I started playing basketball. Daily.
Turns out, when you actually use your body regularly, the cooling system kicks into overdrive. And my cooling system doesn't do subtle. We're talking headbands you can wring out like a wet cloth. Spare shirts as standard inventory. Primary, secondary, and sometimes tertiary waves — because apparently my glands like to send follow-up regards after I've already cooled down.
Somewhere along the way, I stopped fighting it. I started noticing things. Like the grid of tiny droplets that appears on my triceps right when things get serious — my salty wings activating. Like a mech venting heat after combat.
And last time I checked, mechs are fucking cool.
So here we are. SALTY — a small monument to everyone whose body runs a little wetter than spec.

## THE MVP
The MVP
A brief appreciation of the headband.
There's a reason athletes have worn these since ancient Greece. It's not fashion. It's flood control.
“From Greek taenia to Fred Perry towelling gear, the mission has always been the same: keep the flood out of your eyes.”
Without a headband, my face becomes a waterfall approximately seven minutes into any activity. Eyes sting. Vision blurs. Strangers grow concerned. With a headband, I'm a functioning human who can see the basket.
The post-session wringing ritual has become almost meditative. The volume that comes out should not be possible. And yet.
If you produce at industrial scale like I do, the headband isn't an accessory. It's infrastructure.

## BASICS
THE BASICS
Electrolytes. Not vibes.

When it matters
Heat. Effort. Stress. Daily life for high-output units.

What you’re replacing
Mostly sodium. Also potassium and magnesium. Water carries the system. Minerals make it run.

How to use it
Start early. Small and steady beats one heroic chug.
If you feel weird after effort, water alone sometimes isn’t the fix.

Safety line
If you’ve been told to restrict sodium for medical reasons, don’t freestyle. Ask a professional.
